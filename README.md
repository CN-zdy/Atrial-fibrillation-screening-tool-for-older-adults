# Atrial-fibrillation-screening-tool-for-older-adults

This is an easy-to-use tool for atrial fibrillation screening in the elderly. The tool provides three screening methods:

      First: Screening by machine learning model based on age, height, and diastolic blood pressure;
      
      Second: Paper-based electrocardiogram based on scanning and background removal is screened by an artificial intelligence model;
      
      Third: Screening with machine learning models combined with age, height, diastolic blood pressure, and predicted probabilities based on scanned and background-removed paper-based electrocardiograms.
      
Note: All three methods can screen older adults for atrial fibrillation and are suitable for use in a variety of healthcare Settings.
