# Atrial-fibrillation-screening-tool-for-older-adults

This is an easy-to-use tool for atrial fibrillation screening in the elderly. The tool provides three screening methods:

  First (LR.mp4): Screening by machine learning model based on age, height, and diastolic blood pressure;
      
  Second (CNN.mp4): Paper-based electrocardiogram based on scanning and background removal is screened by an artificial intelligence model;
      
  Third (CNN-LR.mp4): Screening with machine learning models combined with age, height, diastolic blood pressure, and predicted probabilities based on scanned and background-removed paper-based electrocardiograms.
      
Note: All three methods can screen older adults for atrial fibrillation and are suitable for use in a variety of healthcare Settings.
